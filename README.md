## About
A different take on overviewing social media profile(s) with this case being Facebook.

Due to strict persmission access for individuals use on their app I cannot access data needed to display the overview but project did serve as a good learning experiece for persistant data and login authorization structuring for React.

Will attempt same approach with Twitter.

### Used
- React [$ create-react-app]
- Facebook Graph API
- Facebook Login [$ react-facebook-login]
